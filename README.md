# frontdetection

The code contained in this repository was developed to analyse data taken with the front detection tool in LG25. In order for it to work you'll need to copy both:

* the analysis folder and
* the Fs calibration folder

to your hard drive In the parent folder in which both reside, create a folder called "data". That's where the front detection data should be stored, one folder per sample. For the analysis run the FrontPL_Analysis.ipynb jupyter notebook.

To do the Fs calibration just copy the data of the calibration measurements into the Fs calibration folder and run the Calibration_Fs_calc.ipynb jupyter notebook.
